				<h2>A Few words About Us</h2>
				<img src="img/pesron.jpg">
				<h3>How our business is started to develop?</h3>
				<p>Do you currently knit sweaters, jackets and more? If so, perhaps you should consider turning your hobby craft into a profitable part-time business enterprise. </p>
				<p>The business is to simply create beautiful and unique hand-knitted products, from sweaters to a clothing line for stuffed animals. The opportunities are endless. </p>
				<p> For the truly enterprising entrepreneur, develop a website that features knit clothing products for sale, as well as a custom made-to-order service where site visitors could simply fill out an order form for the size and style of knit products they want.</p>
